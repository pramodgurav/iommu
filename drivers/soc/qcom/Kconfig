        tristate "QCOM General Serial Bus Interface"
        depends on ARCH_QCOM
        help
          Say y here to enable GSBI support.  The GSBI provides control
          functions for connecting the underlying serial UART, SPI, and I2C
          devices to the output pins.

config MSM_SMD
	depends on MSM_SMEM
	bool "MSM Shared Memory Driver (SMD)"
	help
	  Support for the shared memory interprocessor communication protocol
	  which provides virual point to point serial channels between processes
	  on the apps processor and processes on other processors in the SoC.
	  Also includes support for the Shared Memory State Machine (SMSM)
	  protocol which provides a mechanism to publish single bit state
	  information to one or more processors in the SoC.

config MSM_SMD_DEBUG
	depends on MSM_SMD
	bool "MSM SMD debug support"
	help
	  Support for debugging SMD and SMSM communication between apps and
	  other processors in the SoC. Debug support primarily consists of
	  logs consisting of information such as what interrupts were processed,
	  what channels caused interrupt activity, and when internal state
	  change events occur.

config MSM_RPM_SMD
	bool "RPM driver using SMD protocol"
	help
	  RPM is the dedicated hardware engine for managing shared SoC
	  resources. This config adds driver support for using SMD as a
	  transport layer communication with RPM hardware. It also selects
	  the MSM_MPM config that programs the MPM module to monitor interrupts
	  during sleep modes.

config MSM_SMEM
	depends on REMOTE_SPINLOCK_MSM
	bool "MSM Shared Memory (SMEM)"
	help
	  Support for the shared memory interface between the various
	  processors in the System on a Chip (SoC) which allows basic
	  inter-processor communication.

config MSM_SPM_V2
	bool "Driver support for SPM Version 2"
	help
	  Enables the support for Version 2 of the SPM driver. SPM hardware is
	  used to manage the processor power during sleep. The driver allows
	  configuring SPM to allow different low power modes for both core and
	  L2.

config MSM_L2_SPM
	bool "SPM support for L2 cache"
	depends on MSM_SPM_V2
	help
	  Enable SPM driver support for L2 cache. Some MSM chipsets allow
	  control of L2 cache low power mode with a Subsystem Power manager.
	  Enabling this driver allows configuring L2 SPM for low power modes
	  on supported chipsets

config MSM_SCM
	bool "Secure Channel Manager (SCM) support"
	default n

config MSM_SUBSYSTEM_RESTART
	bool "MSM Subsystem Restart"
	help
	  This option enables the MSM subsystem restart framework.

	  The MSM subsystem restart framework provides support to boot,
	  shutdown, and restart subsystems with a reference counted API.
	  It also notifies userspace of transitions between these states via
	  sysfs.

config MSM_PIL
	bool "Peripheral image loading"
	select FW_LOADER
	default n
	help
	  Some peripherals need to be loaded into memory before they can be
	  brought out of reset.

	  Say yes to support these devices.

config MSM_CPU_PWR_CTL
	bool "Cpu subsystem power control"
	depends on SMP && (ARM || ARM64)
	default y
	help
	  Provides routines to power on cpu rails and l2 cache
	  controller during coldboot.
